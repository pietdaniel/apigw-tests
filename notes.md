### kong
   Lua Based
   Built off of:
    - Nginx
    - OpenResty
      - LuaJIT
    - Kong
   Built in 2010
   Open Source

   NGINX Kong Instances sit behind LB
   Nginx Kong Instances talk to a Datastore (Cassandra / Postgres)
   Many Plugins
   Uses Galileo for Dash/UI
   Does not have SOAP / XML Trans layer
   Has Ratelimiting
   CLI + REST API

### tyk
   Written in Go
   MPL License
   Developed in 2014
   3 Components
   Api Gateway
   Backing Store (Redis, MongoDB)
   Tyk Pump (metrics)
   Tyk Pump Datastore (ES, MongoDB, InfluxDB)
   Plugin Support
    - Lua
    - Python
    - gRPC
   Kong outperforms Tyk on single machine
    5.2k r/s vs 3.8k r/s
   Bunk see's 400k r/s
   This decreases as plugins are added

Under active development, Kong is now used in production at hundreds of organizations 
from startups, to large enterprises and governments including: The New York Times,
Expedia, Healthcare.gov, The Guardian, Cond√® Nast, The University of Auckland, 
Ferrari, Rakuten, Cisco, SkyScanner, Yahoo! Japan, Giphy and so on.

# Testing Plan

 - Create three simple apps
   - python
   - java
   - go
  
 - mix of json APIs + rendered template
 - gRPC as extension
   
 - configure and spin up routing scheme
 - extend to support authn at the edge
 - extend to support circuit breaking
 - benchmarks

## Targets

 - Vulcand
 - Krakend
 - Kong
 - Tyk
